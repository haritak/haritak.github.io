[The idea][1] is to present solutions to the same 
task in as many different languages as possible, 
to demonstrate how languages are similar 
and different, 
and to aid a person with 
a grounding in one approach to a problem 
in learning another. 

Rosetta Code currently has 
1,147 tasks, 
350 draft tasks, and is aware of 
857 languages.
