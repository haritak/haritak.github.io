Stay healthy, stay strong.

An excellent [post on medium][1] by [John Zeratsky][2].

Unfortunattely ([?][mm]) for members only, but you can listen
as you read it, if you make the step to become one.
That's added value for me as a foreign english speaker/learner.

In this the post I read about [High-intensity interval training, or HIIT][3] for
the first time.
