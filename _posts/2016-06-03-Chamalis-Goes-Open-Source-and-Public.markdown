[Chamalis][bitbucketlink] is a php script to help grab the grades of each semester and upload them easily to myschool.sch.gr.

It is the joined effort of glemon, jdiamantakis and me, beta tested for two years (2013-14, 2014-15) by me and kathrin_plastara.

Requires some effort to get it installed (use a [LAMP][lamp]) but after that it is really easy to initialize it, get it working to gather grades and
then download cummulative xls files that can be uploaded to myschool.sch.gr.
