Meet the [Odin Project][1]. 
An open-source, community developed, 
excellent course on learning web development.

Beginning with essential web concepts, moving on to setting up your
development environment and going all the way through editors, 
databases, ruby, ruby on rails to the final stages of getting a job
as a web developer.

Highly recommended.
