Overall, I like it. I am using vi, to write my posts. I can dd, dw, I or A and I have syntax highlight.
I'm learning (still) ruby, and this will get me more into it.

Version control of my website, is another nice feature. But, it's still early. Moreover, I need to find some tools 
to start writing a post immediately. Now I copied an old and used it as a template, which really adds unecessary
delay time to actually start writing. Plus I need to delete all previous stuff.

From googling fast (less than 1 minute) I couldn't find anything. I believe I'll have to write my own script for fast starting a new post.
