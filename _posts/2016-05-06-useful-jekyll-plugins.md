Right now I am test driving [Jekyll compose][jek-comp] which helps creating a page or a post. It's pretty minimal, which is ok and takes out the creation of the file
as well as the subject.

I also installed a [thumbnailer][jek-thum], but I have not figured out yet, what will be the process of including images. There are two basic difficulties here. First
git hub space is only 1GB. I should place any media elsewhere. Secondly, since I don't have a gui, I am not quite sure how to insert an image quickly.
